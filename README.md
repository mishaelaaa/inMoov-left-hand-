Before you start, you must have :
 * Drivers for Leap Motion and Leap Motion SDK (all information you can get of [this](https://developer.leapmotion.com/documentation/))
 * If you white on C#, you must to download [V3 Software](https://developer.leapmotion.com/releases/leap-motion-orion-321) and include ```LeapCSharp.NET4.0.dll``` or ```LeapCSharp.NET4.5.dll```.
